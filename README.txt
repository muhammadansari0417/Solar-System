In order to run, please download file in it's entirety. If you're cloning, disregard first step :). 
Run dependencies.bat and then run regenerate_projects.bat. 
After doing so please go into the bin folder to find "CSCI 4110.sln". 
Once clicked, visual studio will open with the project. 
Set Final Project as the startup project, and press "Local Windows Debugger", or the green play button on the top taskbar.
Also, as we worked on the code together, we pushed on one machine which is why the commits are only from my account.
